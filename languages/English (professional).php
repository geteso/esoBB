As you start new conversations you&#39;ll notice that the tag cloud adapts to the new content of the forum. In time, it&#39;ll become very distinct and will give visitors a good idea of what your forum is about.</p><p>Your forum has been designed to be completely customizable. The forum administrator will be able to choose from a bunch of plugins and skins, and adapt this forum to the needs of its community.</p><p>Anyway, good luck <i>%s</i>, and we hope you enjoy using your &#39;esoteric&#39; forum!</p>",
"postHowToUseContent" => "<h3>Welcome to your forum, let&#39;s get started!</h3><p>The first thing you may notice about your forum is that the index view, in which conversations are listed, is a little different to the other web forums out there. We&#39;ve chosen to move away from the traditional way of organizing posts; instead of using sub-forums we allow you to quickly find what you want by using search terms that we call &#39;gambits&#39;.</p><p>Gambits are simply phrases that describe what you are looking for. Here are some examples.</p><p>If you want to list only the conversations that contain unread posts, double-click on <b>unread</b> in the bunch of words towards the top of the page.</p><p>To view the conversations that have been active during the last day, double-click <b>active today</b>.</p><p>Or to list new replies to your posts, click on <b>unread</b> and <b>contributor:myself</b>, then click the <b>search</b> button.</p><p>Experiment! Gambit searching is actually pretty powerful and we hope that, once you get used to it, it will make your time spent on forums less about clicking and more about talking. <img src='js/x.gif' style='background-position:0 -40px' alt='^_^' class='emoticon'/></p><h3>Tags</h3><p>Gambits aren&#39;t the only way to locate conversations. You can also search by <i>tags</i>, which are snippets of text that describe the topic of a conversation. To search by a tag simply click on the desired phrase in the <i>tag cloud</i>, which is the collection of words above the gambits.</p><p>Thirdly, you can always enter normal search terms into the search bar, just as you would when using Google or Yahoo. Note that unless the forum is configured otherwise search terms must be at least four characters long.</p><p>So now you know how to find the conversations you are interested in. What other things can your forum do?</p><h3>Having a conversation</h3><p>Forums are all about talking! To get started, click on a conversation and try typing a reply. You may be asked to log in before you are allowed to post. If this is the case, type your username and password into the input fields just under the header and click <i>login</i>, or click <i>join this forum</i> if you are not a registered member.</p><p>You may style your reply using some basic formatting options, such as <b>bold</b> and <i>italic</i>, or you may even add a hyperlink. Try experimenting with different formatting options to see what you can do. To see what your reply will look like once it is posted, simply check the <i>preview</i> box.</p><p>Once you&#39;re ready, click <i>submit post</i> and your reply will be added to the conversation. It&#39;s that simple.</p><h3>Starting a new conversation</h3><p>If there are no conversations that catch your fancy why not make one of your own? It&#39;s exactly the same as replying to an existing conversation but with a few added extras. Click the <i>start a conversation</i> button and you will be asked to enter a conversation title and specify some <i>tags</i> to describe the conversation. For example, if you choose to start a conversation about the movie <i>Ocean&#39;s Eleven</i> you might choose the tags &quot;movie&quot;, &quot;Ocean&#39;s Eleven&quot;, and &quot;George Clooney&quot;. Remember: you can have as many or as few tags as you want! If you can&#39;t be bothered thinking of tags for a topic then you may always add them later, or a moderator may add some on your behalf. Conversations do not need tags to be listed.</p><h3>Changing your avatar and color</h3><p>When people are reading a conversation full of posts they may often overlook your username. To help distinguish your posts from those of other members you may specify a profile image, called an <i>avatar</i>, and choose a color for your posts.</p><p>Simply log in and click <i>my settings</i> in your control bar. On this page you will find a section called <i>appearance settings</i> in which you can upload an avatar and select your favorite color.</p><p>While you&#39;re here you can also choose whether you&#39;d like to be emailed whenever someone invites you into a private conversation and whether to receive email notifications of new replies within starred topics. We&#39;ll talk about these a bit more.</p><h3>Private conversations</h3><p>If you&#39;ve used other web forums before you will probably be familiar with the concept of <i>private messages</i>. Your forum expands on this functionality with <i>private conversations</i>, which are simply conversations that may only be viewed and replied to by certain members. A private conversation may consist of just you and a friend, or it may allow access by an entire group, ex. all of the moderators.</p><p>Apart from allowing only certain members to participate, private conversations are identical to normal conversations. To start a new private conversation click <i>start a conversation</i> and locate the <i>members allowed to view this conversation</i> section. By default it will say &quot;everyone&quot;, but you may change this by adding in a member. Try typing the name of your friend and clicking <i>add</i>. You will notice that it now lists your friend as the only other member allowed to view the conversation, and a <i>private</i> label will appear beneath the conversation title.</p><p>To list all your private conversations from the index, use the <i>private</i> gambit. You can refine your search by using other gambits too, for example <i>private + unread</i> will list only your private messages that contain unread replies.</p><h3>Starred conversations</h3><p>You may occasionally find a conversation that you want to pay close attention to. Rather than memorize the search string you used to find the conversation, you can <i>mark it with a star</i> by clicking on the star icon next to the conversation title. Then, simply use the <i>star</i> gambit in the search to bring up a list of all the conversations that you have starred.</p><p>Another benefit of starring conversations is that you can choose to receive email notifications whenever someone posts a new reply in the starred conversation. Check the appropriate box in <i>my settings</i> and your forum will handle the rest.</p><h3>Draft conversations</h3><p>We know that posting long replies can take a while. Sometimes you may be interrupted or need to resume later. When this is the case, click <i>save draft</i> and your reply or conversation will be saved in a way that is only visible to you. To list conversations that contain one of your draft replies, use the <i>draft</i> gambit.</p><h3>My favorite gambit searches</h3><p>As mentioned previously, gambits are powerful both for forum regulars and guests searching for a specific piece of information on a newly-found forum. Here are some of the gambit combinations that I find useful or interesting! <img src='js/x.gif' style='background-position:0 -100px' alt=';)' class='emoticon'/></p><ul><li><b>My new private messages:</b> private + unread</li><li><b>New replies to my posts:</b> contributor:myself + unread - private</li><li><b>Hot topics of the last week:</b> active last 7 days + order by posts</li><li><b>Replies to my recent conversations:</b> author:myself + active last 2 weeks + has replies</li><li><b>All-time most popular conversations:</b> order by posts</li><li><b>My failed conversations:</b> author:myself + !has replies</li><li><b>Random recent conversations:</b> random + active last 1 weeks - private - sticky</li></ul><p>Experiment to find your own favorites!</p><p>The quickest way to become familiar with your forum is to start using it, so get posting!</p><p>We hope you enjoy using our software. <img src='js/x.gif' style='background-position:0 0' alt=':)' class='emoticon'/></p><p>- <a href='https://github.com/geteso' target='_blank' class='external' onclick='return Conversation.externalLink()'>esoBB team</a></p>",
"postHowToCustomizeContent" => "<h3>Hey %s, congrats on getting <b>eso</b> installed!</h3><p>Cool! Your forum is now good-to-go, but you might want to customize it with your own logo, design, and configuration settings - so here&#39;s how.

If you&#39;re not interested in making more advanced design changes then make sure the logo isn&#39;t higher than ~30px.</li><li>Upload the logo to your webserver. If you&#39;re not sure where to put it, just stick it in the same place you put the <code>eso</code> files.</li><li>Edit the file <code>config/config.php</code>.</li><li>Somewhere <b>after</b> <code>\$config = array(</code> and <b>before</b> <code>);</code>, add the following line: <code>&quot;forumLogo&quot; =&gt; &quot;http://your.server.com/logo.jpg&quot;,</code> (make sure the <a href='http://your.server.com' target='_blank' class='external' onclick='return Conversation.externalLink()'>your.server.com</a> path points to the place were you uploaded your logo).</li><li>If your logo graphic already contains your forum name, you can hide the text title by editing <code>config/custom.css</code> and adding the following code: <code>#forumTitle {display:none}</code></li><li>Refresh your forum index and check it out!</li></ol><h3>Choosing your skin</h3><ol><li>Log into your forum and click <code>Skins</code>.</li><li>In the <code>Add a new skin</code> section, click <code>Browse</code> to select the skin archive you previously downloaded, then click <code>Add skin</code>.</li><li>Click on the picture of the newly-added skin to activate it.</li></ol><h3>Plugins</h3><p>Plugins are these nifty little things that add extra functionality to your forum.

Some plugins have settings which you can change by clicking <code>settings</code> to the right of the plugin name.</p><h3>Advanced configuration settings</h3><p>See all the configuration variables in <code>config.default.php</code>?

You can download language packs and install them by uploading them into the <code>languages</code> of your forum&#39;s installation.</p><p>Each user can select from any of the language packs you have installed, but you can set a default by editing <code>language</code> entry in your advanced configuration settings. See the <i>Advanced configuration settings</i> section above for details of how to do this.</p><p>If you&#39;d like to make a custom change to the language of your forum (ex. changing the footer text), find the appropriate language entry in the language file and override it in <code>config/custom.php</code>.</p><h3>We hope you enjoy using your forum!</h3><p>There are a whole bunch of other things you can do to customize your forum, but that sorta stuff is getting a bit too advanced for this tutorial.
